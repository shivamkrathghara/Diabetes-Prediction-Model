# Diabetes-Prediction-Model
**Machine Learning Project On Pima Indian dataset**

Diabetes is one of the largest global health challenges of this century.The International Diabetes Federation has estimated that globally there are 415 million people with diabetes in 2015 and is predicted to increase to 642 million by 2040. so diabetes has become a major issue for the human society.
In this project i am applying statistical learning techniques to predict the diabetes on pima indian women. The dataset was collected by The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases conducted a study on 768 adult female Pima Indians living near Phoenix.

**About Dataset-:**
The dataset contains the following variables
pregnant
Number of times pregnant
glucose
Plasma glucose concentration at 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
diastolic
Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
triceps
Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
insulin
2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
bmi
Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in metres squared))
diabetes
Diabetes pedigree function
age
Age (years)
test
test whether the patient shows signs of diabetes (coded 0 if negative, 1 if positive)

**Data Exploration & Modelling 
in this section we found that some variables have minimum values assigned to zero like skin thickness , glucose , so we replace these zeroes with median values.
since data is not in very large number so we fill them by median values. Then we have done Univariate and biavriate analysis.
after this step we make our Model which is based on logistic regression which has an accuracy of 77 % **
