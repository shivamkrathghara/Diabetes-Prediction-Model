Machine Learning Project On Pima Indian dataset

In This Project I have applied Logistic Regression Model and Random forest model in the PIMA indian women dataset collected from R faraway package 
Before applying the two important task have been carefully reviwed , cleaning  and EDA.

Logistic regression gives model with accuracy of 77 % and sensitivity 63% 
while the random forest model has given accuracy of 76% and sensitivity 60.8 % sensitivity rate 
The Model has deployed in the R shiny Module.
